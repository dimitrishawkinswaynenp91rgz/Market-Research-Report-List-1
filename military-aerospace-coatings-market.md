<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Military Aerospace Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Based Coatings</li><li>Water Based Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Military Aerospace Coatings market is segmented into two types - Solvent Based Coatings and Water Based Coatings. Solvent Based Coatings are traditional coatings that use solvents as a carrier for the paint or finish. They provide a durable and glossy finish, but have high levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). On the other hand, Water Based Coatings are environmentally friendly alternatives that use water as a carrier. They have lower VOC levels and are easier to clean up, making them a more sustainable choice for military aerospace applications.</p></p>
