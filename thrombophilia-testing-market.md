<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thrombophilia Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automated Testing</li><li>Semi-automated Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thrombophilia testing is divided into two types: automated testing and semi-automated testing. Automated testing involves the use of advanced technology and machinery to perform the tests, allowing for faster and more accurate results. These systems automate the entire testing process, from sample preparation to analysis. On the other hand, semi-automated testing combines manual and automated techniques. It requires some level of human involvement, such as handling the samples and data interpretation, while certain steps are automated for efficiency. Both types aim to diagnose thrombophilia efficiently and accurately.</p></p>
