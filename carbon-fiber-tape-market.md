<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Fiber Tape Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Prepreg Tape</li><li>Dry Tape</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Prepreg tape and dry tape are two types of carbon fiber tapes used in various industries. Prepreg tape consists of carbon fibers pre-impregnated with a resin matrix, offering high strength and stiffness. It is widely used in aerospace and automotive applications. On the other hand, dry tape is a reinforcement made of dry carbon fibers that need to be infused with resin before use. Dry tape is preferred in applications where specific resin systems are required or for customization purposes. Both types offer lightweight and high-performance solutions for composite material manufacturing.</p></p>
