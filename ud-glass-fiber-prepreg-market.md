<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The UD Glass Fiber Prepreg Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoset</li><li>Thermo-plastic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>UD Glass Fiber Prepreg is a type of composite material that consists of glass fiber reinforcements impregnated with resin before the curing process. In the market, two main types are distinguished based on the resin used: Thermoset and Thermoplastic. Thermoset prepregs utilize resins that undergo irreversible chemical reactions during curing, resulting in a rigid and durable final product. On the other hand, Thermoplastic prepregs use resins that can be repeatedly melted and solidified, offering the advantage of recyclability and reshaping potential. Both types cater to different applications and industries within the composites market.</p></p>
