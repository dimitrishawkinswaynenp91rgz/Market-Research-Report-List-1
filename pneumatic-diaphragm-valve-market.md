<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Diaphragm Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normally Closed Type</li><li>Normally Open Type</li><li>Reciprocating Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pneumatic diaphragm valves come in three main types based on their operation: Normally Closed Type, Normally Open Type, and Reciprocating Type. Normally Closed Type valves are closed in their natural state and open when compressed air is applied. Normally Open Type valves are the opposite, being open without any air pressure and closing when activated. Reciprocating Type valves have a flexible diaphragm that moves back and forth to control the flow of air or liquid. Each type caters to specific applications and industries.</p></p>
