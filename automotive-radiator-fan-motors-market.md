<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Radiator Fan Motors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Type</li><li>Electric Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive radiator fan motors market consists of two types: mechanical type and electric type. Mechanical fan motors are driven by the engine's belt system, and they operate whenever the engine is running. They use a clutch mechanism to engage or disengage based on the engine's temperature. Electric fan motors, on the other hand, are powered by electricity and are controlled by sensors that detect the engine's temperature. They automatically turn on and off to regulate the engine's cooling system, providing a more efficient and convenient cooling solution.</p></p>
