<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Underwater Switches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Limit Switches</li><li>Proximity Switches</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Underwater switches market includes two main types - Limit switches and Proximity switches. Limit switches are mechanical switches that are activated by physical contact, typically used to detect the presence or absence of an object at a certain position. Proximity switches, on the other hand, use non-contact technology such as magnetic or capacitive sensing to detect the presence of an object without physical contact. Both types of switches are crucial in underwater applications where traditional switches may not be suitable due to water exposure.</p></p>
