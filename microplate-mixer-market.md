<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microplate Mixer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vortex Mixer</li><li>Orbital Mixer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microplate mixers are essential laboratory equipment used for mixing liquids in microplates. Vortex mixers utilize rapid, circular motion to thoroughly mix samples by creating a vortex within the tube or microplate. Orbital mixers, on the other hand, use a gentle circular shaking motion to mix samples evenly. Both types of mixers are commonly used in applications such as PCR, ELISA, and cell culture. Researchers can choose between vortex and orbital mixers based on the sample type and mixing requirements of their experiments.</p></p>
