<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PCR PET Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>m-PCR</li><li>c-PCR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>m-PCR and c-PCR are two types of PET resin markets within the broader PCR PET Resin market. m-PCR, or mechanical recycled PCR PET resin, is produced through mechanical processes like sorting, cleaning, and shredding post-consumer PET waste. On the other hand, c-PCR, or chemical recycled PCR PET resin, is produced through chemical processes like depolymerization of PET waste into its monomers and then repolymerization to produce new resin. Both types play a crucial role in the sustainable production of PET products by utilizing recycled materials.</p></p>
