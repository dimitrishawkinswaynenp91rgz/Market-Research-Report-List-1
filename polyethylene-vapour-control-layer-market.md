<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyethylene Vapour Control Layer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Density Polyethylene Vapour Control Layer</li><li>Low Density Polyethylene Vapour Control Layer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyethylene Vapour Control Layers are commonly used in construction to prevent moisture migration. The High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) Vapour Control Layer offers higher strength and durability, making it suitable for heavy-duty applications. On the other hand, the Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) Vapour Control Layer is more flexible and cost-effective, ideal for lighter applications. Both types provide effective moisture protection, but the choice between HDPE and LDPE depends on the specific requirements of the project.</p></p>
