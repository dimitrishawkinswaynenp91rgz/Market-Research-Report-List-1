<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Containment Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid</li><li>Semi-rigid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Containment barriers are used to restrict the movement or spread of a substance or object within a specific area. There are two main types of containment barriers: rigid and semi-rigid. Rigid barriers are made of strong, inflexible materials such as concrete or steel, providing maximum resistance to external forces. Semi-rigid barriers, on the other hand, are made of materials that can bend or flex slightly, allowing them to absorb some impact without breaking. Both types of barriers have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the containment application.</p></p>
