<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The β-blockers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nonselective Agents</li><li>Selective Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>β-blockers are a type of medication commonly used to treat various conditions such as high blood pressure, heart rhythm disorders, and migraines. Nonselective β-blockers act on both β1 and β2 receptors, blocking their functions, while selective β-blockers target only the β1 receptors. Nonselective agents are typically used in cases where β2 receptor blockade is desired, such as in treating symptoms of asthma or migraines. Selective agents are preferred for conditions like high blood pressure, as they have fewer side effects on the lungs and blood vessels.</p></p>

<p><strong>The β-blockers Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Abnormal Heart Rhythms</li><li>Hypertension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>β-blockers are medications that block the effects of the hormone epinephrine on the β receptors in the body. In the market, they are commonly used to treat abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) by slowing down the heart rate and reducing palpitations. They are also widely prescribed to manage hypertension (high blood pressure) by blocking the action of epinephrine on the blood vessels, leading to vasodilation and decreased blood pressure. Therefore, β-blockers find applications in the treatment of both abnormal heart rhythms and hypertension in the medical industry.</p></p>
