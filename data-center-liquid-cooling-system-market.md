<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Data Center Liquid Cooling System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Liquid Cooling System</li><li>Direct Liquid Cooling System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Data center liquid cooling systems are designed to regulate the temperature of data centers by using liquids as a cooling medium instead of air. There are two main types of liquid cooling systems: indirect and direct. Indirect liquid cooling systems use a heat exchanger to transfer heat from the servers to a liquid coolant, while direct liquid cooling systems involve circulating liquid directly to the servers for cooling. Both systems offer more efficient cooling and better heat dissipation compared to traditional air cooling methods.</p></p>
