<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Energy Efficient Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hard Coat</li><li>Soft Coat</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Energy efficient glass is categorized into two main types: Hard Coat and Soft Coat. Hard Coat glass is coated with a layer of metallic oxide during the manufacturing process, making it durable and scratch-resistant. Soft Coat glass, on the other hand, has a thin layer of metal applied to the surface in a vacuum chamber after the glass is manufactured, making it more energy efficient by reflecting heat back into the room. Both types of energy efficient glass are designed to reduce heat loss and enhance insulation in buildings.</p></p>
