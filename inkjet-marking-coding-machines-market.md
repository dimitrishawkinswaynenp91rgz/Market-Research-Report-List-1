<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inkjet Marking Coding Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CIJ</li><li>DOD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inkjet marking coding machines are divided into two main types: Continuous Inkjet (CIJ) and Drop on Demand (DOD). CIJ machines continuously emit tiny droplets of ink onto a surface, allowing for rapid and continuous marking. DOD machines, on the other hand, only release ink droplets when needed, making them more precise and efficient for certain applications. Both types of machines are widely used in various industries for product labeling, coding, and marking requirements.</p></p>
